## Introduction
We propose a novel **AdversarialNAS** method, which is the **first gradient-based fully differentiable NAS method in GAN field** and achieves state-of-art performance with much higher efficiency. We also design a large architecture search space for GAN and make it feasible to search in.

- [ ] Supporting [Amended Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11831.pdf)


## Train and Test the searched architecture.
### Training
1. Train the weights of generative model with the searched architecture (the architecture is saved in ./exps/arch_cifar10/Genotypes/latest_G.npy)
    
    ~~~
    sh scripts/train_arch_cifar10.sh
    ~~~
    or
    ~~~
    sh scripts/train_arch_stl10.sh
    ~~~
   
### Testing
1. Download the two trained generative models ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Kqc5aImZ2vHJ1SH1HkrHjlk0MZeuM6q?usp=sharing) and [Baidu Drive (passcode: bk1m)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_1K6mqKxGj3_TBbJcSUE-Q)) to ./exps/arch_train_cifar10/Model and ./exps/arch_train_stl10/Model respectively.

    ~~~
    mkdir -p exps/arch_train_cifar10/Model exps/arch_train_stl10/Model 
    ~~~
   
2. Test the trained model
    ~~~
    sh scripts/test_arch_cifar10.sh
    ~~~
    or
    ~~~
    sh scripts/test_arch_stl10.sh
